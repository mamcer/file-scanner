# FileScanner

A .NET Library from 2013

In `original` branch you will find the original source code for this application. In `master` an upgraded, refactored version.

## Description

For a side project (ISO Finder and some others) I ended implementing a file system scanner which also read some specific file properties. At that moment I decided to separate it in order to reuse this code.

It consists of a class library and a little winform application which to exercise it.
